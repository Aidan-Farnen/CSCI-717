For this assignment, I believe the code that leads to a better output is the gemini code.
You start by entering a ciphertext into the sourcecode and it will output a starting point based on letter frequency.
From there you will need to manually edit the cipher key to make changes by looking at the output
and making logical conclusions yourself on what letters to swap for others.
Running this over and over again and swapping letters in the key should hopefully lead to a solved cipher.

The chatgpt code doesn't really solve the cipher at all. You can manually insert a new ciphertext into the
sourcecode and then execute. It will produce different candidates with scores that it thinks solves the cipher
better. Here the higher score is supposed to be a better answer. However, I have seen that candidates with 
a lower score seem to be a better solution. Maybe you could be the judge of that.
